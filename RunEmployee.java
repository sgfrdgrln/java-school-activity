// Instruction

// 1. Create four (4) Java classes. Name them: RunEmployee, Employee,
// FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee. The RunEmployee shall contain the main method
// and will be used to execute the program.

// 2. Write a simple payroll program that will display employee's information.
// Refer to UML Class Diagram for the names of the variable and method. This should
// be the sequence of the program upon execution:

// a. Ask the user to input the name of the employee

// b. Prompt the user to select between full time and part time by pressing
// either F (full time) or P (part time).

// c. If F is pressed, ask the user to type his monthly salary. Then, display his 
// name and monthly salary.

// If P is pressed, ask the user to type his rate (pay) per hour and the number of
// hours he worked for the entire month seperated by a space. Then, display name
// and wage.

// Note: You can add variables and methods if needed. Just make sure that all the 
// variables and methods given in the diagram are properly used.

// Employee class should contain a String name, a getter and setter method setName(): void, getName(): String
// FullTimeEmployee class should contain double monthlySalary, a getter and setter method
// setMonthlySalary(): void, getMonthlySalary(): double
// PartTimeEmployee class should contain double ratePerHour, int hoursWorked, double wage, a getter and setter
// method setWage(): void, getWage() : double
